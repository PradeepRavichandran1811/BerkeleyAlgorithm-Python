# BerkeleyAlgorithm-Python
    Hello !!
     I have implemented Berkeley Algorithm for clock synchronization using socket programming in python. 
     Here the Server is the master and Client1 and Client2 are the slaves. Server polls the Clients to get their time and calculates average time difference.
     Using the average time difference, the Server synchronizes it's clock with that of all the Clients.
